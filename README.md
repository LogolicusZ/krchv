Or, Keyboard Archive.\
Pronounced: "Kay-Archive".

## Why does this exist?

I want to have a space dedicated to one of my favorite hobbies which also acts as an archive in case I lose the original files. Additionally, I want to be less dependent on other services like Instagram (for image storage) and Notion (storage database of current items that I own).
This page like, my main [Website](https://logolicusz.com), will be using [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Who is this for?

Mainly me, fu\*\* off.\
But, you're free to use this however you want to, as long as you adhere to the [license](./LICENSE).
