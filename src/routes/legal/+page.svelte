      <p>
        Welcome to my website! As a privacy-conscious individual myself, I'm dedicated to protecting your privacy and ensuring
        that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This privacy policy outlines how I
        collect, use, and protect your data when you browse <span class="font-mono text-primary">stelian.net</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact me
        <span><a href="/about#contact">here</a>.</span>
      </p>
      <h3 id="functionality" class="mt-8">Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        For some website functionalities, such as this website's dark mode switcher, I store your preferences in your
        browser's
        <span
          class="help cursor-pointer underline decoration-dotted decoration-primary"
          data-tip="Local storage saves website data on your device, similar to but different from cookies. It persists after closing the browser and doesn't automatically send data to servers with each request, unlike cookies.">
          local storage
        </span>.
        Here is an example as to how the dark mode preference might be saved:
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-100 text-base-content rounded-md p-4 overflow-x-auto text-sm font-mono">"theme": "portfolioDark"</pre>
      <p>Any information stored like this stays on your device, and never gets sent to my server.</p>
      <p>
        Some blog pages might also have interactive content such as YouTube video embeds. By clicking 'play' on a video,
        you accept
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        If you do not wish to do so, do not click on YouTube video embeds on the blog.
      </p>
      <h3 id="analytics" class="mt-8">Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit any page on this website, a small piece of data is collected and sent to my
        <span
          class="help cursor-pointer underline decoration-dotted decoration-primary"
          data-tip="Self-hosting means that I am in control of the software. It runs on my own servers in Europe.">
          self-hosted
        </span>
        <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plausible</a>
        instance.
        <br />
        It's important to note that:
      </p>
      <ul class="!list-disc ml-6">
        <li>No personal information is collected</li>
        <li>No cookies used for analytics are stored in the browser</li>
        <li>No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties</li>
        <li>No information is shared with advertising companies</li>
        <li>No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends</li>
        <li>No information is monetized</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I run the Plausible Analytics script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to
        track overall trends in my website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate
        only.
        <span class="font-semibold text-primary">Absolutely no personal data is collected for analytics.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type,
        operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in Plausible's
        <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data policy</a>.

      <h3 id="general-log-collection" class="mt-8">General Log Collection</h3>
      <p>When you visit my website, the webserver automatically logs the following information:</p>
      <ul class="!list-disc ml-6">
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>User agents</li>
        <li>Request paths</li>
        <li>Times of requests</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've set the logs to
        <span
          class="help cursor-pointer underline decoration-dotted decoration-primary"
          data-tip="Technical term for cycling old files, to flush old data.">
          roll
        </span>
        every 72h or 100MB (whichever comes first), after which, the file gets deleted. If you wish for me to delete your information,
        please contact me
        <span><a href="/about#contact">here</a>.</span>
        The information is solely used for debugging and to prevent bot attacks.
